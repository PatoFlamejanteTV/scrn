## 2024-10-27 - [Secure Memory Lifecycle]
**Vulnerability:** `std::vector` reallocation (via `resize`) does not wipe the old memory block before freeing it, allowing sensitive data (like screen content) to linger in the heap. Also, forced termination (Ctrl+C) bypasses RAII destructors.
**Learning:** `SecureBuffer` wrappers must explicit wipe the *entire* existing buffer before any `resize` operation (even growth) to ensure the old data is destroyed before the vector frees/reallocates it. For clean exit, use `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` to toggle a global atomic flag, allowing the main loop to exit and destructors to run.
**Prevention:** Always wipe buffer before resize. Always implement signal handlers for secure apps.
